# nba-contracts

A data visualization project that plots NBA player statistics in the 2015/16 season against their expected salary for the next season. The project was built using Flask and D3. Player and salary statistics used in this project were taken from the following sites:

[basketball-reference.com](http://www.basketball-reference.com/)
[stats.nba.com](http://stats.nba.com/leaders/#!?Season=2015-16&SeasonType=Regular%20Season)

A live [demo](https://nba-salary-scatterplot.herokuapp.com/) of this app is hosted on Heroku.
